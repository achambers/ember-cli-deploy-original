# ember-cli-deploy

> An Ember-CLI addon for lightening fast deployment of applications

## Motivation

This addon was inspired by [Luke Melia][1]'s RailsConf 2014 presentation - [Lightning Fast Deployment of Your Rails-backed JavaScript app][2].

## Synopsis

This plugin is designed to aid in the deployment workflow of an [Ember CLI][5] application. The workflow is designed to follow on from a successful `ember build` command and runs as follows:

- Create an [Ember CLI][5] build
- Deploy assets to S3
- Deploy index.html to Redis
- (At some point afterwards) Activate a released index.html to be the current live version

## Installation

From within your [Ember CLI][5] application, run:

```shell
npm install --save-dev ember-cli-deploy
```

## Configuration

Any of the command line options passed in to the following commands can alternatively be either exported as environment variables or specified in a `.env` file.

Simply change the option flag to be `UPPERCASED` and `UNDER_SCORED`, eg:

`--redis-host` would be specified as `REDIS_HOST`

## *ember deploy:assets*

This command is responsible for pushing your assets to an S3 bucket.

### Usage

```shell
ember deploy:assets <options>
```

### Options

#### --dist-dir (optional)
Default: `dist`

Should point to the `dist` directory that contains the built assets.

#### --s3-access-key-id (required)

The access token that has permission to push to your S3 bucket.

#### --s3-secret-access-key (required)

The token secret that belongs to the `s3-access-key-id`.

#### --s3-bucket-name (required)

The S3 bucket to push assets to.

#### --s3-region (optional)
Default: `us-east-1`

The region that your S3 bucket sits in.

## *ember deploy:index*

This command is responsible for pushing your index.html file to a Redis instance.

### Usage

```shell
ember deploy:index <options>
```

### Options

#### --dist-dir (optional)
Default: `dist`

Should point to the dist directory that contains the built index.html.

#### --redis-host (required)

The host server of the Redis instance to deploy the index.html to.

#### --redis-port (required)

The host port of the Redis instance to deploy the index.html to.

#### --redis-password (optional)
Default: `null`

The password of the Redis instance to deploy the index.html to.

### --git-root (optional)
Default: ''

The path to your project git repository. Unless specified here, this will default to your project root.

## *ember activate*

This command is responsible for activating a deployed index.html file.  The process of activating the index.html file will update the `index:current` entry in Redis to be the index.html file for the specified `<key>`.

### Usage

```shell
ember activate <key> <options>
```

### Arguments

#### \<key\> (required)

This should be the short commit hash for the a previously deployed index.html file.

### Options

#### --redis-host (required)

The host server of the Redis instance to deploy the index.html to.

#### --redis-port (required)

The host port of the Redis instance to deploy the index.html to.

#### --redis-password (optional)
Default: `null`

The password of the Redis instance to deploy the index.html to.

## Tests

To run the tests, run:

```shell
npm test
```
